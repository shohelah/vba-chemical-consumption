# vba-chemical-consumption
In this project, I developed a VBA script to collect consumption data for 'Chemicals/Dyes' and 'Dyes' categories from multiple Excel sheets and calculate the total (sum) for each product code. The script automates header identification and presents results in a Summary sheet.
